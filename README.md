# BotfortheLads

This is abot that is currently running on an Ubuntu machine. This bot is written in python and is based off an older repository but reworked to run in linux.

## Functionality

### !help
Displays a dialog box containing the information here

### !ping
A basic ping command to see if the bot works.

### !uptime
Uptime status command

### !hotkey, !delhotkey, !addhotkey, !listhotkey
All hotkey related commands, can send/delete/add/view all hotkeys at your disposal.

### !convert
A function to convert between imperial and metric units.

It is in the works to add versitility to the function, however, that's further down the line when I come up with a satisfactory solution.

### !c
~~Converts the at.tumblr.com link to a regular permalink~~

This function is a bit defunct, I have no idea to what capacity it works anymore.

### !fruit    
A command that prints out an ASCII representation of a fruit. The command !help fruit will show all available options.
